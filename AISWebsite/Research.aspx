    <article>
        <p>As an education provider of programmes up to level 7 (Bachelor) and 9 (Master), AIS takes very seriously its commitment to a research culture. This commitment manifests itself in many ways.</p>
        <p>In 2014, Dr Adam Brown was appointed the Director of Research, with overall responsibility for research-oriented activity within the institution.</p>
        <p>The Research Committee, comprising senior members of AIS teaching staff, other research-active staff, and an adjunct research professor, meets regularly in order to plan research initiatives.</p>
        <p>Annual Research and Publication Report is produced, showcasing AIS researchers’ outputs and other activities. See recent reports. </p>
        <p>The AIS Research Newsletter is produced at least three times per year. Each issue of the newsletter contains a featured AIS researcher, articles on various aspects of the research process, recent research outputs by AIS staff, and upcoming conferences. View copies of the newsletter.</p>
        <p>The AIS Research Award recognises those staff who have produced quality outputs over the previous year. There are two categories: Established Researcher, for those staff with PBRF rankings, and Emerging Researcher, for those without. Some “honourable mentions” are also recognised.</p>
        <p>The Centre for Research in International Education (CRIE) aims to provide a forum for conducting research into the social, economic and pedagogic consequences of the internationalism of education. It has several regular activities:</p>
        <p>The double blind peer-reviewed Online Journal of International Education is published twice a year.</p>
        <p>An international conference is hosted biennially.</p>
        <p>Research papers and working papers are downloadable from the CRIE website.</p>


        <p>For more on CRIE, go to the CRIE website.</p>

        <p>Any academics interested in the possibility of conducting joint research with AIS staff, should contact the staff member (Staff can be found under their respective Programme page).</p>
